	return "A collection of several closely-related amphibian bipedals, the Ordoht (once known as the 'Skrell') are a distinctly varied race recognizable for their flared heads, angular eyes and and highly diverse colorations. Compared to many of the other races, Ordoht are not especially commonly seen, and their visual diversity can make it hard for onlookers to discern their species at all."

		"Historically a civilization of vast intellect and power, the modern Ordoht are little but a shadow of what they once were. A victim of their own technological prowess, the Ordoht fell prey to a self-replicating terraforming technology they themselves developed, turning their homeworld Ordo (and everything) into something entirely and horrifyingly new.",

		"A small selection of Ordoht alive at the time of this initial exodus managed to escape and pool their scientific expertise together, ultimately venturing into a space beyond reality via some of the earliest application of bluespace technology known to all the races. This legendary blind jaunt did not just teleport them elsewhere - it severed them from the concept of location altogether. Postulations by remaining Ordoht scientists suggest these individuals (known as the Somnolant) exist as a 'metaphysical liquid' without form, though still alive. As such, the Ordoht are swift to blame many local phenomena across a wide variety of circumstances on the Somnolant, and some dedicate their lives to researching the topic.",

		"The other remaining Ordoht aboard colony ships at the time fled their system into the great unknown, some following the course of the successful terraforming probes that were released before the Exodus, while others simply let fate decide their landing points. Many colonised swampy, marsh-like planets, and while their population did recover somewhat, they are a far cry from the zenith of their bygone Golden Age.",

		"The modern-day Ordoht are a relatively small player in the galactic scene, favoring academic pursuits. Ordoht scientists are renowned for their biotechnological prowess, with many space-hardy plant and mushroom cultivars created from the intrepid minds of an Ordoht bioengineer."
